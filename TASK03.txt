This project uses a retail Superstore dataset to practice basic SQL.
Here is what we did:

1. Imported the CSV file

The dataset was loaded into a table called raw_superstore.

2. Created clean tables

We made four tables:

customers

products

orders

order_items

3. Moved data into these tables

We inserted customer, product, order, and sales data from raw_superstore into the new tables.

4. Practiced SQL queries

We used:

SELECT

WHERE

ORDER BY

GROUP BY

JOIN

LIMIT

AS (alias)

MONTH(), DATEDIFF() (date functions)

5. Found insights

Examples:

Top-selling products

Monthly sales

Shipping delays

Profit by category

Orders per customer
